# Intro to CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and visual formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows web developers to separate the structure and content of a webpage from its design, enabling control over layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall aesthetics.

CSS works by applying a set of style rules to HTML elements, which can be defined inline, internally within the HTML document, or externally in separate stylesheet files. This separation promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and greater flexibility to create responsive and accessible web designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

By learning CSS, you gain the ability to transform plain HTML content into visually engaging and user-friendly websites. These exercises from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) will guide you through foundational CSS concepts, helping you build skills in selectors, box model, layout techniques like flexbox, and the cascading nature of styles.

Mastering CSS is essential for any aspiring web developer, as it forms the backbone of web design and user interface creation.
